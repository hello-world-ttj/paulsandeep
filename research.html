                    <p class="mb-1">Dissertation Committee Chair(s): Dr. Catherine Weaver and Dr. Patrick Bixler, LBJ School of Public Affairs.</p>
                    <p>This dissertation explores the role of policy communities in agenda setting and policy formation of urban climate policies in India. Policy communities are networks of specialists like researchers, academics, scientists, and policy experts with shared frameworks, expertise, and interests in a particular policy domain – in this instance, climate change policy in urban areas. Through case studies of three Indian cities – Surat, Pune and Kochi, the dissertation seeks to explain and theorize how policy communities emerge, function, and contribute to the formation and implementation of urban climate policy</p>

                    <p class="mb-1">Guide: Dr. Sandhya Iyer, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.</p>
                    <p>This thesis project was completed as part of M. A in Development Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Through this research, I analyzed and documented labour market conditions in the natural rubber small holdings and plantations in Kerala, India. Based on semi structured interviews with sixty-nine key informants and sample surveys among rubber tappers in Kerala, the work explained the vulnerability of rubber tappers and labour market outcomes in the post liberalization period in India. </p>
